# Paul Lamb's Sound System & JOrbis/JOgg Source Code Archive

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Preservation Project

This repository is a **mirror and preservation effort**. The original libraries, authors, and download links are over a decade old, and many of the official sites are now defunct. This repository was created to ensure that this valuable code remains accessible to Java game developers for educational and historical purposes.

**I am NOT the author of this code.** All credit for this incredible work belongs to the original creators:
-   **Paul Lamb** for the Sound System, CodecJOrbis, and CodecWav.
-   **JCraft, Inc.** for the JOrbis (Ogg Vorbis) and JOgg (Ogg container) libraries.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a stable, accessible location for the source code that I and others may use in our own projects, in accordance with the original licenses.
